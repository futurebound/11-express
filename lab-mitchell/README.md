# Lab 12 ~ Express Middleware

**Author**: Mitchell
**Version**: 1.0.0

## Overview
We were tasked to create an HTTP server using the `express` NPM package. After learning how `express` works beneath the hood, it is wonderful to now have it helping out with the heavy lifting. We needed to create an object constructor that creates a simple resource for us with 3 properties, and I chose the simple model of student names and cities of residence. The properties on the constructed student objects are `name`, `city`, and a `._id` generated by the `UUID` NPM package. 

This application leverages the `body-parser` NPM package to parse the request body on `POST` and `PUT` routes. We also included the `debug` NPM module to assist developers in understanding what is happening with these requests, where, and to elicit deeper knowledge of the application overall. The application also utilizes a storage module and file system persistence through the use of the `fs` NodeJS module.

## Getting Started
To get this application up and running, fork and/or clone this repository using the `git clone <git repository link>` command in your terminal. Next, run the `npm install` command, which will install all the necessary dependencies in the accompanying package.json file. After those packages have installed, you can run `npm test` to explore the included tests and functionality of their respective solutions. You can open up the code in your favorite editor to explore/modify the code, see how the tests are structured, and create tests of your own if desired. `npm start` will start a nodemon server from the index.js entry point. `npm run test:debug` will include debugger information when viewing the included tests. `npm run start:debug` will start up the nodemon server like `npm start`, but with the addition of debugger flags in the console.
